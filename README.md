# Todo App Add and Delete

## 🎮 About the Project
This is the second part of the **Todo App** project. In this part, functionality for **adding** and **deleting** todos is implemented. It builds on the first part, where todos are loaded from an external API. In this section, users can add new todos and delete existing ones.

The full project consists of three parts:
1. [Load Todos](https://github.com/AndriiZakharenko/todo-app-loading-todos) - Fetches and displays todos from the API.
2. **Add and Delete** - Implements the functionality to add and delete todos.
3. [Toggle and Rename](https://github.com/AndriiZakharenko/todo-app-with-api) - Allows toggling and renaming todos.

In this second part, you can manage your todos by adding new ones and deleting them as needed using external API interactions.
